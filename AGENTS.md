# GitNexus — Code Intelligence

This project is indexed by GitNexus as **opencode-memory-enhanced** (2664 symbols, 7908 relationships, 70 execution flows). Use the GitNexus MCP tools to understand code, assess impact, and navigate safely.

> Index stale? Run `node .gitnexus/run.cjs analyze` from the project root — it auto-selects an available runner. No `.gitnexus/run.cjs` yet? `npx gitnexus analyze` (npm 11 crash → `npm i -g gitnexus`; #1939).

## Always Do

- **MUST run impact analysis before editing any symbol.** Before modifying a function, class, or method, run `impact({target: "symbolName", direction: "upstream"})` and report the blast radius (direct callers, affected processes, risk level) to the user. For unified PDG impact, add `mode: "pdg"` with optional `line: <N>` — it returns statement-level `affectedStatements` over CDG + REACHING_DEF and inter-procedural symbols in `interproceduralByDepth`/`byDepth`; no-layer/degraded PDG results are UNKNOWN-risk notes (`--pdg` layer).
- **MUST run `detect_changes()` before committing** to verify your changes only affect expected symbols and execution flows. For regression review, compare against the default branch: `detect_changes({scope: "compare", base_ref: "master"})`.
- **MUST warn the user** if impact analysis returns HIGH or CRITICAL risk before proceeding with edits.
- When exploring unfamiliar code, use `query({search_query: "concept"})` to find execution flows instead of grepping. It returns process-grouped results ranked by relevance.
- When you need full context on a specific symbol — callers, callees, which execution flows it participates in — use `context({name: "symbolName"})`.
- For security review, `explain({target: "fileOrSymbol"})` lists taint findings (source→sink flows; needs `analyze --pdg`).
- For control/data dependence, `pdg_query({mode: "controls", target: "fileOrSymbol"})` answers "under what condition does X run?" (CDG, incl. guard clauses) and `pdg_query({mode: "flows", target, variable})` traces "where does variable Y flow?" (REACHING_DEF). `--pdg` layer.

## Never Do

- NEVER edit a function, class, or method without first running `impact` on it.
- NEVER ignore HIGH or CRITICAL risk warnings from impact analysis.
- NEVER rename symbols with find-and-replace — use `rename` which understands the call graph.
- NEVER commit changes without running `detect_changes()` to check affected scope.
